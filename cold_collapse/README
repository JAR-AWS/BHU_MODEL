There is an implementation of the Homologous Dust Collapse, a 'pressure-less'
configuration that collapses under its own gravity, as a test problem in CASTRO code.  
The test problem uses an analytic solution that describes the radius of the sphere as a 
function of time, as found in Colgate and White (1966).  This problem is also found in
the FLASH User's Guide and Mönchmeyer and Müller (1989).

We have modified this test problem by adding an infall velocity which then gives us an
exact GR solution to the problem for k=0 (flat space) with zero pressure.

A low-density, rho_0, is placed inside a sphere of radius r_0.  The
pressure should be negligible, formally, $p_0 << 4 \pi G rho_0^2 r_0^2 / \gamma$ (see Flash Users Guide). 
It is not clear what value of p_0 different papers use so we use $p_0 = 1e10$ << $p_0 = 1e19$ that
comes from the RHS of the inequality above.

We simulate the collapse starting from 100 times the gravitational radius and evolve until t = tc (collapse time).
We use the following initial conditions:
	$\rho_0 = 2.8e8 g/cm^3$
	$r_0 = 2.39e8 cm$
	$u_0 = -2.99e9 cm/s (which is 0.1*c)$
	
We find that the simulation results follow exactly the theoretical GR solution until Black Hole formation, which is marked by
the radius crossing the gravitational radius and the coordinate velocity crossing the speed of light.
